# Tuan's Sample Code #
This is a repo for code that I have written for class projects, work, and personal use.

## Project Descriptions ##
**Analysis of GDS3227**
- Final project for a gene analysis course, where I analyzed a dataset from Wang et al., who wanted to investigate the effects of social isolation at a genetic level.
- Techniques Used: Feature Selection (SVM to rank genes by p-value), Data Visualization, PCA, MDS Analysis (Kruskal and Classical Approaches)
- Language(s): R

**Metagenomics Scripts**
- Scripts for metagenomic analysis
- `blat_run.py`: Perform blat on samples
- `bowtie2_built.py`: Builds index for bowtie2
- `bowtie2_local_align_single.py`: Runs bowtie2 in local alignment mode for each sample in a folder
- `calculations.py`: Contains some analyses performed on metagenomic samples
- `fasta_fastq_summary_stats.py`: Script for summarizing sequence and residue count for a sample
- `frp_create.py`: Creates fragment recruitment plots for SAM and PSL files.
- Language(s): Python
